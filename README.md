One of the major advancements in delivery services is the use of drones to deliver parcels. In these services, one drone is assigned to a delivery task. This drone has to first pick up the parcel and then move to a given delivery location while avoiding collisions with obstacles. This motivated us to implement a displaying system for drone's pathfinding in a 3D space. In other words, we designed a system that creates a 3D grid map with obstacles and computes the shortest path from a drone's starting position to a destination. Also, it displays a 3D representation that can be manipulated so that the correctness of the path is validated. We modified the usability of the A* algorithm in order to work in our 3D coordinate system.
